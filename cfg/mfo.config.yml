# Icons per row
# Allows overriding the default icon layout by specifying an array of integers
# indicating how many icons to use per row.
# This new layout will only be used if the sum of all rows matches exactly the
# number of apps, and if no row exceeds the maximum number of icons allowed (6).

# Show language switcher menu (true/false)
#
# NOTE: It's not always a good idea to enable a language switcher. It will make
# it more difficult for people coming across the station and people watching over
# the user's shoulder to understand what's going on and they might just walk
# away or waste time finding how to switch languages instead of playing with our
# software. Enable ONLY if needed for the exhibition.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you enable the language menu choose which languages to show
# wisely! Select only those appropriate to the exhibition and avoid showing
# more than one local variant of the same language.
# Also only enable languages for which translations are available.

langMenuShow: false

#
# Indicate which languages to show if the language switcher menu is shown
# (use ISO 639-1 language codes)
