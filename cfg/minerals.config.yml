# Logo image to show on top of the menu.
# It's possible to specify a single image file or to configure each language
# separately. If separate languages are used then any languages without an
# image will use the title instead. Use 'default' as a language code to have
# a default fallback logo image.
#
# example: Single image for all languages:
#
# logo: assets/img/lg_imaginary_white.png
#
# example: Only use logo for english and german
#
# logo:

# Show language switcher menu (true/false)
#
# NOTE: It's not always a good idea to enable a language switcher. It will make
# it more difficult for people coming across the station and people watching over
# the user's shoulder to understand what's going on and they might just walk
# away or waste time finding how to switch languages instead of playing with our
# software. Enable ONLY if needed for the exhibition.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you enable the language menu choose which languages to show
# wisely! Select only those appropriate to the exhibition and avoid showing
# more than one local variant of the same language.
# Also only enable languages for which translations are available.
#
langMenuShow: true

#
# Indicate which languages to show if the language switcher menu is shown
